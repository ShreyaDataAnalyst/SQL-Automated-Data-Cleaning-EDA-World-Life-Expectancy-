# Python: Food Marketing Data Analyst




## Project Overview

Using Kaggle's dataset, for this project, I analyze MFood's customer data to evaluate marketing effectiveness and customer engagement, with a focus on campaign performance and customer spending behaviours across different customer groups.




## Key Questions: 

1) Which customers spend the most and frequently respond to campaigns?
2) What patterns or behaviours can help target different customer groups more effectively?
3) Do customers prefer ordering through the website, physical stores, or catalogs? Which channels lead to better campaign acceptance?



## Steps Taken

1) Data Cleaning & Manipulation: Removed duplicates and joined columns with similar columns (e.g., marital statuses, education levels) to streamline analysis.
2) Correlation Analysis: Explored connections between campaigns and customer characteristics (e.g., age, spending, purchase channels, marital status, children, education).
3) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Used Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to visualize and understand the dataset.





## Key Findings

1) Customers aged 30-70 spend the most but are less likely to engage with campaigns, despite their high volume of spending.
2) Catalog buyers are more likely to accept campaigns, even though most purchases happen in physical stores.
3) Customers with no or fewer children are more likely to accept campaigns and spend more.
4) Education has minimal impact on campaign engagement—targeting based on education isn’t necessary.
5) Marital status isn’t a strong factor, but married, single, and partnered customers tend to spend more.


## Recomendations

Target middle-aged, high-income customers with no children across different platforms. These customers are most likely to accept campaigns and spend more money.
